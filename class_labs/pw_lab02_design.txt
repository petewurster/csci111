init variables to 0 (total, quarters, dimes, nickels, pennies)
coin vars stored in dictionary for later iteration

get input from user as total (in cents)
	attempt to cast total to int
	throw exception and quit if casting fails

direct conversion of total to enumerated coins via integer-division & modulus operators: this requires less lines of code than it would to update the remaining total after each conversion

loop over 'coins' to build output string

print results
